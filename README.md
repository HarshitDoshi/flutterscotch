# flutterscotch

During my summer holidays, in May 2019, I had my first taste of Flutter. Google had just finished it's annual developer event - Google I/O - and all the tech forums and news sites were talking about just one thing - Flutter.

I decided to get my hands dirty with the craft of app development and Flutter seemed perfect. I started reading the official Flutter documentation and variious blogs.
